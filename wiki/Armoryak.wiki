#Thoughts on the Armor.yak file

The start of the file is consists of structures, each 0x30 bytes long.

Each of these structures consists of 4 children, each 0x0c bytes long.

These children consist of 3 integers (little ending, 4 bytes each).

The first integer is an offset to a texture.

The second integer is an offset to vif data.

The third integer is the length of the vif data.

so, something like this:
{{{
struct Child
{
int textureOffset;
int vifOffset;
int vifLength;
}

struct Entry
{
   Child[4] children;
}
}}}
The start of the file then consists of an array of Entry structures.
